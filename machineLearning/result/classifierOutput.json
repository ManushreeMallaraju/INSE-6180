It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written however better inflection phrasing pauses etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th. Its just that poorly written.I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.I think I'll donate it to my local library.\"",

The first couple of wearings were difficult but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body. I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it (sort of like the top part of panty hose). I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around. It is not comfortable to wear while sitting. For me I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter as I think my torso is shorter than most. I do think it is helping but I need to wear it for more hours. I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep rather than in the daytime but I have not tried that yet. The product is well made.\"",

I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable.

Unavoidably there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements but he does more than that he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it.

One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral or pink than scarlet or red. Also the back cover is white and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless the binding will look fair on my bookshelf.

Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins and how honesty for some comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes and less exposition it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy.\"",

The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts motivations strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn the vengeful doctor the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study though at times it's little slow.Overall a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily it's free!\"",

It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story may not be considered exciting but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this \"\"perfect\"\" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing foil characters and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her \"\"lover's\"\" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some but don't let this keep you from reading it because it really is good.\"",

Yes the book was written over 100 years ago but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood.\"",
