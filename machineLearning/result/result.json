It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written however better inflection phrasing pauses etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th. Its just that poorly written.I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.I think I'll donate it to my local library.\"",

For example in chapter 11 (Tariffs) the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports I quit reading.In short I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow' the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow.\"",

This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer.\"",

I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try.\"",

As far as the smell it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day. The same thing with the waist cincher the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall great product.\"",

I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts' no hips or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast hips and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself it failed.\"",

I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on) especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately.\"",

I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain. I will never buy these again.",

Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises for most of its adherents Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements but he does more than that he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic but it was well worth it for this reader.\"",

Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone.",

Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins and how honesty for some comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes and less exposition it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy.\"",

The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts motivations strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn the vengeful doctor the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study though at times it's little slow.Overall a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents.

This book is about a woman who has an affair choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity.

        "review": "\"Characterization in The Scarlet Letter: The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman Hester has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships revenge immense guilt and sin. This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society. The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story.\"",

It seems too that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers.I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading. Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written. What I always find fascinating is that this like most other classics is about human nature power and the consequences of actions. So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others- to be voyeurs-which is what makes a classic a classic.\"",

The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature hypocrisy and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately beyond the limits that society sets.

Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life. The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of \"\"The Custom House\"\" however horrible this sounds I would just skip it it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway.\"",

        "review": "\"Timeless Classic: I enjoyed this book a lot once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter \"\"A\"\" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around so at the end of the book people refer to her as \"\"Angel\"\" instead of \"\"Adulterer.\"\"This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone regardless of their sin. Also the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins the only person it ultimately hurts is us.\"",

        "review": "\"One of the Greatest Books Ever Written: The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over and I feel that it's one of the best ever written.\"",

I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too. It's not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time this book required my full attention.\"",

I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!\"",

        "review": "\"Useful for AP Lit: I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love society's oppression secrets a character finding herself as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test this is the book I chose. Sure enough this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature.\"",
